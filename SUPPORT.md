## How to Get Help

We love helping our community, but please follow these steps first:

1. :book: **Read the documentation**  
   - Check the `docs` or readme of the related project
   - Explore any example projects to see how they work.  
   - Many answers can be found in [Discord](https://discord.gg/prjUvjmGpZ) or [Forum](https://forum.source-robotics.com/) without waiting for a reply 
  
2. :mag: **Search before asking**  
   - Look for similar issues in the GitHub repository.  
   - Search on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for common problems (related to basic stuff like git, python, compilation errors...)
   - Use Google, Chatgot or your favorite search engine for related terms.

3. :speech_balloon: **Ask in our community channels**  
   - [Discord](https://discord.gg/prjUvjmGpZ) ‚Äì for quick discussions and brainstorming  
   - [Forum](https://forum.source-robotics.com/) ‚Äì for detailed technical questions  

4. :memo: **As a last resort, open a GitHub Issue**  
   - Clearly describe your problem or question.  
   - Include what you have already tried.  
   - Provide relevant code snippets or error messages (not your entire project).

## Asking High-Quality Questions

Help us help you!  
A well-structured question saves everyone time.

- Clearly define your goal:  
  - *What are you trying to do?*  
  - *What‚Äôs the exact problem?*  
  - *What have you already tried?*
- Avoid the [XY Problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378) ‚Äî ask about your actual goal, not just your attempted solution.
- Screenshots are helpful, but also include important text (like error logs) as plain text.

## What *Not* to Do

Please **do not**:
- ‚ùå DM or email maintainers asking for free private support  
- ‚ùå Open duplicate issues or spam "+1" comments  
- ‚ùå Post vague questions without details or steps to reproduce  

Public questions get public answers ‚Äî this helps the whole community.
