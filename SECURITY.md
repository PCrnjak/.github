# Security Policy
## Usage and Safety Disclaimer for Source Robotics Projects

The Source Robotics projects, including robotic arms and associated parts, are designed **solely for engineering development, demonstration, and evaluation purposes**. They are **not final consumer products** and **should only be handled by individuals with proper electronics and robotics training** who follow sound engineering and safety practices.

**Important Considerations:**

- These projects **may not comply with regulatory standards** such as EU directives (EMC, RoHS, WEEE), FCC, CE, UL, or others due to their open-source nature and user-supplied components.
- The user **assumes full responsibility and liability** for the safe assembly, operation, and maintenance of the hardware.
- Users **must take all necessary precautions**, including but not limited to wearing appropriate protective equipment, ensuring safe work environments, and understanding risks related to electricity, mechanical motion, and other hazards.
- Users **must comply with all applicable local laws, regulations, and safety standards** when building or operating these robotic systems.
- It is strongly recommended to **read all related documentation and manuals thoroughly** before assembly or use.
- After building, users should **familiarize themselves thoroughly with the robot control software and safe operation procedures**.
- **Robots can cause burns, electrocution, physical injury, or other harm** if mishandled.

**Liability and Warranty Disclaimer:**

- The Source Robotics team **disclaims all warranties**, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose.
- **Neither party shall be liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages** arising from the use or inability to use the products.
- Users agree to **indemnify and hold harmless the Source Robotics team** from any claims, damages, or liabilities resulting from the use or misuse of these products.

By proceeding to build or use Source Robotics projects, you acknowledge and accept these terms.

## Our Commitment  
Ensuring the safety and security of users and their hardware is our top priority. We welcome security reports from researchers to help us identify and resolve vulnerabilities.

## Scope  
This policy applies to all hardware, firmware, software, and related services governed by our organization. Some hardware features may involve inherently risky operations; if these are clearly documented, they are not considered security issues.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities  
If you discover a security or safety issue, please report it privately by emailing **info@source-robotics.com**. Do **not** disclose issues publicly or via issue trackers. Provide detailed, reproducible steps, specify the hardware model/version, firmware/software involved, and clearly describe potential impact or risks. Submit one vulnerability per report.

## Our Response  
- We acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 96 hours or 3 business days.  
- We maintain strict confidentiality and do not share your personal information without permission.  
- We keep you informed on progress toward resolution.  
- With your consent, we credit you as the discoverer after issues are resolved.

## Safe Harbor for Researchers  
We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:  
- Act in good faith, avoid causing harm to hardware, firmware, or software, and prevent safety risks to users.  
- Only access hardware or systems they own or have explicit permission for.  
- Immediately report and delete any accidental access to sensitive data.  
- Provide us reasonable time to address vulnerabilities before public disclosure.

## Prohibited Actions  
Exploiting vulnerabilities, performing unsafe manipulations that could cause physical harm, or social engineering (e.g., phishing) are strictly forbidden.

## Supported Versions  
Security support covers actively maintained hardware models, firmware, and software versions. Please refer to individual project documentation for details.
